# IoT-based-Accident-Detection-System

Road accidents continue to be a pressing global issue, causing immense loss of life, in-
juries, and property damage. Prompt and effective emergency response is critical in mit-
igating the impact of accidents and saving lives. However, traditional accident reporting

mechanisms may suffer from delays, inaccuracies, and limited coverage, which can hinder
timely intervention. To address these challenges, an Internet of Things (IoT) based accident
detection system is proposed in this project.

The proposed system utilizes the advancements in IoT, sensor technologies, and com-
munication networks to enable real-time detection of accidents and automatic alert gener-
ation. It employs Arduino Uno as the main controller board, and integrates GPS and GSM

modules for location tracking and SMS alerting, as well as tilt, impact, and fire sensors for

accurate detection of various accident scenarios. ESP32 CAMs are installed around the vehi-
cle and triggered by the sensors to capture images of the accident scene. When an accident

is detected, the system sends SMS alerts with GPS location and vehicle details to emergency
services and registered contacts, and captures images of the accident scene using triggered
cameras, which are sent as email alerts.

The proposed system aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for accident detec-
tion, notification, and emergency response, leveraging the capabilities of IoT technologies.

The insights gained from this project are expected to contribute to the field of road safety
and emergency services, and can be valuable for researchers in the transportation domain.
